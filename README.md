# Sendy â€“ A Simple WeTransfer Clone on the Edge

**Sendy** is a minimalist file-sharing application inspired by WeTransfer, built with **Nuxt** and **NuxtHub**. It runs on Cloudflare Workers at the edge, supports large files via multipart upload, and automatically deletes them after 4 days using Nitro tasks.
